Mouse Jiggler in CircuitPython for ATSAMD21 or Raspberry Pico

Nothing complicated, just requires CircuitPython [M0](https://circuitpython.org/board/neopixel_trinkey_m0/)/[Pico](https://circuitpython.org/board/raspberry_pi_pico/) higher than version 7.0.0 (support for code.py rather than rebuilding CircuitPython).

The code is the same for both SAMD21 devices (I used an [Adafruit Neo Trinkey](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-neo-trinkey-samd21-usb-key-with-4-neopixels) for £6.30) or Raspberry Pi Pico [(£3.60 from Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico?variant=32402092294227)).
