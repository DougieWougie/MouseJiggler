# Raspberry Pi Pico Mouse Jiggler

CircuitPython on Pico doesn't include Adafruit's HID library and will require you to add `adafruit-circuitpython-hid`. The library bundle is available [here](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HID), you only need adafruit_hid - copy it to the lib folder on your Pico.
